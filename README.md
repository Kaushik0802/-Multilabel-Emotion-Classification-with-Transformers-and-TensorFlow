I recently led the development of a multilabel emotion classification system using DistilRoBERTa, TensorFlow, and Hugging Face Datasets. The project focused on identifying and classifying multiple emotions in text, ensuring high accuracy and scalable real-time deployment.

🔍 Key Highlights
Data Preprocessing:
Tokenized text with DistilRoBERTa tokenizer (max length: 64) and preprocessed labels into one-hot encoded vectors.
Standardized data pipelines using Hugging Face Datasets for consistent I/O handling.
Model Architecture:
TensorFlow model integrating:
DistilRoBERTa for feature extraction.
Global Average Pooling for dimensionality reduction.
Dense layers (256 and 128 units with ReLU activation).
Dropout (0.3) for regularization.
Sigmoid activation for multilabel output.
Fine-tuned transformer layers for domain-specific adaptation.

Training Strategy:
Optimized with Binary Cross-Entropy loss and Adam optimizer (lr=2e-5).
Implemented learning rate scheduling and model checkpointing for robust training.
Trained over 5 epochs with a batch size of 32.

Evaluation:
Achieved strong metrics: Micro F1 (overall accuracy) and Macro F1 (class-wise balance).
Conducted per-emotion F1 analysis, identifying strengths across individual labels.

Deployment:
Developed a Flask REST API for real-time predictions.
Deployed the model on an Azure Virtual Machine, ensuring scalability and availability.

Inference:
Preprocessed test data with Pandas and ensured prediction-label alignment.
Generated Micro/Macro F1 scores and per-label F1 scores on unseen test data.

💡 Tools & Technologies
Transformers: DistilRoBERTa, Hugging Face Datasets.
Deep Learning: TensorFlow, custom RNN architecture.
Backend: Flask REST API.
Deployment: Azure Virtual Machines.
Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
This project demonstrated the power of transformers and multilabel classification for solving complex NLP tasks at scale. I’m excited to apply these techniques to future challenges.
